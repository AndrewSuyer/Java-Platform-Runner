# Java-Platform-Runner
A platformer game I made for my final project in AP computer science A, which I took in junior year. This project is written entirely in Java and uses the swing library for graphics.

## Features
  - 2 "worlds" each containing 4 levels for a total of 8 levels.
  - Realistic player movement using kinematics equations
  - Animated player movements (walking, jumping, squatting)
  - 6 types of blocks (solid, breakable, transparent, deadly, background, and other)
